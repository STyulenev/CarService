A learning task for Java backend development.
Implementation of a web service for managing a network of car shops.
The store has a spare parts database, as well as several branches where spare parts can be purchased.
The service allows administrators to add/edit/delete information about spare parts and branches, as well as
specify the number of spare parts in stock in a particular branch.
Users have the opportunity to choose and buy a spare part in a specific branch (of course, if the spare part is available).
Unregistered users can view the list of available spare parts and their availability in different branches.
